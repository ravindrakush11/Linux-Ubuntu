Great! You're in your Linux home directory (`/home/ravin`), and you already have a `projects` folder.

Here’s how to **create and run a basic Python file** from your current location:

---

### ✅ 1. **Create a Python file**

You can use any text editor. Let’s use `nano` (a simple terminal-based editor):

```bash
nano hello.py
```

Paste this code inside:

```python
print("Hello from your WSL Python environment!")
```

Then:

* Press `Ctrl + O` → Enter (to save)
* Press `Ctrl + X` (to exit)

---

### ✅ 2. **Run the Python file**

Now simply run it using:

```bash
python3 hello.py
```

You should see:

```
Hello from your WSL Python environment!
```
