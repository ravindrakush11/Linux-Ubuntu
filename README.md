✅ Step 3: Always Work Inside Linux Filesystem
You should always create and save your code/projects in:


/home/ravin/your_projects_here
Not in:


/mnt/c/Users/your-windows-folders
To go to your home directory anytime:


cd ~


✅ Step 1: Switch to ravin (from root)
From your current terminal as root:

su - ravin

✅ If you’re already logged in as a non-root user (like ravin):
Run:

sudo -i
